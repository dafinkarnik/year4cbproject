Instructions on how to obtain and build a specific Chromium version on Linux.

To obtain:

cd ~
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
export PATH="$PATH:${HOME}/depot_tools"			# You might be required to repeat this step on each new terminal or after a restart
mkdir ~/chromium && cd ~/chromium
cd src
fetch --nohooks chromium
git fetch --tags
git checkout -b v65 65.0.3287.0				# Replace with other version if needed
gclient sync --with_branch_heads --nohooks
sudo ./build/install-build-deps.sh
gclient runhooks



To build while in the 'chromium/src' dir after the previous steps have completed:

# Replace original library files with changed ones now if desired
gn gen out/builddir     				# or 'gn args out/builddir' to be prompted to supply arguments, refer to https://www.chromium.org/developers/gn-build-configuration
ninja -C out/builddir
